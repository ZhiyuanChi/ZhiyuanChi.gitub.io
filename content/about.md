I am a graduate student at ucsd global strategy and policy college.
Currently, I am pursuing the degree of International Affair with a focus on Environmental issues.

This summer, I am interning at California Energy Commission as the Charging Infrastructure Intern. My interest of 
environment grows in the summer of 2022 during which I took a 
backpack trip around west and north Europe on train.

I exchanged in Barcelona for almost one year and now I am study in San Diego. 
These two cities are beside ocean, and I have the chance to fully enjoy the nature.

Therefore, I really wish to protect the environment and contribute to the practical business pattern related with
sustainable industry products.
